    "# Qonnect Four  \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired from the classical game Connect four, Qonnect Four works using the principles of quantum circuits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "_A game by Praveen Jayakumar._  \n",
    "\n",
    "The game format is partially inspired by the Quantum Dojo (https://github.com/amirebrahimi/quantumdojo)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The game  \n",
    "\n",
    "A random circuit will be initiated over the seven qubits. On each turn, each player either adds a single or two qubit gate or can opt to perform a measurement. On performing measurements, the output is recorded and if 0, Player 1 takes that spot, else it goes to player 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent state of the system will be projected to the measured state and the game continues till one person gets four \"0000\" or \"1111\" in a single row/column/diagonal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A player can only perform a single measurement in a turn, but if the measurement leads to collapse of any other qubit to classical state ($|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$) due to entanglement, that too would be considered as a measurement and a coin would be added. The catch is you either get multiple coins in a turn or might end up helping your opponent.  \n",
