# QonnectFour  
A quantum game inspired by the classic board game Connect four.  
(Version 1.1)

_A game by Praveen Jayakumar._  

The game format is partially inspired by the Quantum Dojo (https://github.com/amirebrahimi/quantumdojo)  

To play the game, download/clone the repository locally and open `QonnectFour.ipynb` notebook on Jupyter notebooks or other compatible platforms.  

(`QonnectFour.py` and `QonnectFour.ipynb` are required to run the game successfully)  

As of version 1.1, you can play on multiple devices connected to the same local network. To do so, run the Server.py script in the background on one of the system. Change the Server_IP addresses in the Jupyter notebooks, and the Server.py file to the IPv4 address of the system running the Server.  

Follow instructions given in the Jupyter notebook.

## Requirements:  
This game requires the installation of qiskit, numpy, matplotlib, pillow (PIL)
